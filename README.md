# Learn about Balancer

## Overview:

> Balancer is at its core an automated market maker or "AMM". AMMs are required for decentralized finance in order to create markets for assets to be exchanged between individuals without regulation. The price of assets is set by the holders and traders strictly through supply and demand without any boundaries of entry for users.&#x20;
