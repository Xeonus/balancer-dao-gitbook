# Financial Implications

veBAL is financially beneficial to lockers in 3 ways:

* [Boosting BAL incentives for staking BPT's (Balancer Pool Tokens)](boosting-bal-incentives/)
* [Protocol Revenue Distribution](protocol-revenue-distribution.md)
* [Allocating Liquidity Incentives via Gauge Voting system](gauge-voting.md)

Gauges will be voted for through mainnet only, here delegation of BAL incentives can be done across all chains and gauge approved pools.&#x20;

Users can view the current pools eligible for gauge voting [here.](https://app.balancer.fi/#/vebal) Interested in proposing your project's token to be eligible for voting? Check out the [instructions](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/instructions-overview/2674) page on our forum.&#x20;
