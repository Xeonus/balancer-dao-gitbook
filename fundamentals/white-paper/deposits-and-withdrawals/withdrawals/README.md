# Withdrawals

Balancer Protocol allows users to redeem their investments from pools in a two possible ways. _Proportional withdrawals_ yield no price impact and follow the ratios the pool is already in.&#x20;

_Single Sided withdrawals_ permit users to withdraw from a pool in the form of only one of the assets. A price impact due to shifting the internal relationship of the tokens will be accounted in this scenario.&#x20;

See examples of each withdrawal type in the following pages:

* [Proportional Withdrawal](proportional-withdrawals/)
* [Single Sided Withdrawal](singled-sided-withdrawals/)
