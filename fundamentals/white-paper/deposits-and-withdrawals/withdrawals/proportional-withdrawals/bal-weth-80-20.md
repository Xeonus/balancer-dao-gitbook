# BAL/WETH 80/20

At the time of writing the BAL / WETH 80/20 pools has the following traits:

* _**Swap fee: 0.05%**_
* _**BAL: 5,682,882**_
* _**WETH: 6,232.9054**_
* _**BPT: 2,891,832.103892**_

Under the same conditions shown in the [deposit example](../../deposits/proportional-deposits/bal-weth-80-20.md) we will determine the amount of each token we would receive if we redeemed the 254.433587 pool tokens we were issued. The amount we receive should be the same as we would invest for the issued amount because the pool traits are constant in this example.

This solidifies the premise of accounting for the pool issuing and redeeming pool tokens Given the pool traits the minting or burning (investment or withdrawal) of pool tokens will respect the ratios of the balances within the pool and the percentage of total pool tokens.
