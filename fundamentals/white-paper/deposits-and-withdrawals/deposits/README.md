# Deposits

Balancer Protocol allows users to invest in pools in a variety of ways. _Proportional deposits_ yield no price impact and follow the ratios the pool is already in.&#x20;

_Single Sided Deposits_ permit users to deposit into a pool with only one of the assets. A price impact due to shifting the internal relationship of the tokens will be accounted in this scenario.&#x20;

_Multi-token Deposits_ are when a user deposits the tokens they have in an unproportional way. Not a single asset but multiple in a non-proportionate way.

See examples of each deposit type in the following pages:

* [Proportional Deposits](proportional-deposits/)
* [Single Sided Deposits](single-sided-deposits/)
* [Multi-token Deposits](multi-token-deposits/)
