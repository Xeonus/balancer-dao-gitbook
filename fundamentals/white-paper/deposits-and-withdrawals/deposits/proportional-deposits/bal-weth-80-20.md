# BAL / WETH 80/20

At the time of writing the BAL / WETH 80/20 pools has the following traits:

* _**Swap fee: 0.05%**_
* _**BAL: 5,682,882**_
* _**WETH: 6,232.9054**_
* _**BPT: 2,891,832.103892**_

Letâ€™s assume we want to invest 500 BAL, and proportionally this would prompt us to invest 0.548393 WETH to maintain the pool balance (see The Value Function section for reference). We know our amount in and balance in of each token. The ratio of Dk over Bk will be the same regardless of which token is chosen in proportional investments and withdrawals:
