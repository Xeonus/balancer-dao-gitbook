# veBAL Tokenomics

Balancer DAO is extremely excited to introduce the newest iteration of tokenomics for the Balancer governance token (BAL). On February 10th, 2022, the vote for [veBAL Tokenomics](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x9fe19c491cf90ed2e3ed9c15761c43d39fd1fb732a940aba8058ff69787ee90a) began. By a landslide of 361,000 votes to 147, the changes have been approved by the governance process. The vote ended three days later February 13th leaving the community riddled with anticipation. Implementation of the new tokenomic model comes coupled with several key points.&#x20;

Since the initial proposal, a key change has been made regarding the gauge voting. 100% of emissions will be controlled by veBAL holders across all networks. In this case no liquidity mining committee will be required and veBAL will only receive the percentage, which pertains to the voting done the veBAL holders. See more on these changes [here.](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x21aaaaeb9343c7876ae6c6aeee2d478237987edf43b7be946c92a947b7186634)&#x20;

The highlights are vote-escrowed locking of BAL / WETH pool tokens, gauge voting for veBAL token holders to determine where liquidity mining emissions are allocated, incentives boosting, protocol revenue distribution, and a well-defined BAL inflation schedule. With all these updates wrapped into one package many of our community members may be left asking: what does this mean for me?
